                                                    In its state of expanding, Perntels has introduced the discipline of civil works that deals with the design,
                                                    construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads,
                                                    bridges, canals, dams, and buildings. Civil work takes place in the public sector from municipal through to
                                                    national governments, and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies.
