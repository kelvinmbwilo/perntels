                    <p> In its state of expanding, Perntels has introduced the discipline of civil works that deals with the design,
                        construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges,
                        canals, dams, and buildings. Civil work takes place in the public sector from municipal through to national governments,
                        and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> We offer design and construction-related services for new building as well as provide expansion, renovation and refurbishment of existing facilities.
                        We listen to understand the needs of our client, form the best team of people with the right attitude, skills and experience and then deliver the project in a timely and responsible manner.
